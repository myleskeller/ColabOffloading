# ColabOffloading

A (slowly increasing) collection of `.ipynb` notebooks created or streamlined by me that leverage the **_thicc_** GPU backend of Google Colab.

  * ## blenderCLI
  Made to leverage GPU backend of Google Colab in rendering Blender .blend files.  
  Works fine for me as of 23MAR2021.

  * ## firstOrderMotionModel
  Streamlined to focus on quickly uploading and processing your own content with the model.  
  Works fine for me as of 21APR2021.
