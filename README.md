# ColabOffloading

A (slowly increasing) collection of `.ipynb` notebooks created or streamlined by me that leverage the **_thicc_** GPU backend of Google Colab.

  * ## [blenderCLI](https://colab.research.google.com/github/myleskeller/ColabOffloading/blob/main/blenderCLI.ipynb)
  Made to leverage GPU backend of Google Colab in rendering Blender .blend files.  
  Works fine for me as of 21APR2021.

  * ## [firstOrderMotionModel](https://colab.research.google.com/github/myleskeller/ColabOffloading/blob/main/firstOrderMotionModel.ipynb)
  Streamlined to focus on quickly uploading and processing your own content with the model.  
  Works fine for me as of 21APR2021.
